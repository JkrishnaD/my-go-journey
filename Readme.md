# Go Language Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning Go, covering the basics to advanced concepts, and implementing mini-projects to solidify each stage of my understanding.

 These are the topics are topic and projects which are i decided to complete to get hands-on experience on go-language

## Getting Started

### Go Installation and Setup

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Verify the installation by running `go version` in your terminal.
3. Set up a development environment with your preferred editor (VSCode recommended) and configure Go plugins.

### Basic Syntax and Key Concepts

- **Variables and Constants**: Learn about declaring variables (`var`), constants (`const`), and type inference.
- **Data Types**: Understand Go's basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
- **Control Flow**: Explore `if`, `for`, and `switch` statements.
- **Functions**: Practice defining functions, handling multiple return values, and basic error handling.
- **Collections**: Work with arrays, slices, and maps for data storage.
- **Structs and Interfaces**: Use structs to define complex data types and interfaces to build modular code.
- **Concurrency**: Use goroutines and channels to build concurrent programs.

### 2. Temperature Converter

**Description**: CLI tool to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, including error handling.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Function creation and return values
- Error handling

### 3. Inventory Tracker

**Description**: Manage a list of inventory items using slices for items and maps for details.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Arrays, slices, and maps
- Iteration with loops

### 4. Student Database

**Description**: CLI tool to store and retrieve student records using structs and methods.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Structs and methods
- Pointer receivers

### 5. Payment Processor

**Description**: Implement a mock payment processing interface with polymorphism for different payment methods.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Type assertions

### 6. Concurrent Web Checker

**Description**: Check the status of multiple websites concurrently, using goroutines and channels.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Concurrency with goroutines and channels

## Final Project: Task Management System

**Description**: A CLI or web-based task manager where users can create, view, update, and delete tasks. Implement concurrency for real-time updates if using a web server.

**Learning Objectives**:

- Combining structs, methods, interfaces, concurrency, and error handling
